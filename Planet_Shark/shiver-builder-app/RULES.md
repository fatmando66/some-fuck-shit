## Introduction

Planet Shark Shiver Builder is a web application that helps players create and manage their Shivers (teams of Sharkanoids) for the Planet Shark tabletop game. This document serves as a comprehensive guide to both the game's core concepts and how to use the Shiver Builder application.

## Game Overview

Planet Shark is a tabletop miniatures game where players control teams of Sharkanoids - anthropomorphic sharks with various abilities and equipment. The game takes place in a futuristic setting where these Sharkanoids battle for supremacy.

Key concepts:
- **Shiver**: A team of Sharkanoids (like a squad or warband)
- **Sharkanoid**: Individual shark-like fighters with unique stats and abilities
- **Points**: Currency used to build balanced Shivers (standard game is 100 points)
- **Supply**: Resource for equipping weapons and gear to Sharkanoids
- **Actions**: Number of activities a Sharkanoid can perform each turn

## Shiver Builder Features

The Shiver Builder application provides the following functionality:
- Create a Shiver with up to 100 points of Sharkanoids
- Choose from different Sharkanoid templates (PUP, BULL, VETERAN, MECH)
- Equip weapons and equipment using each Sharkanoid's Supply limit
- Add special Extras that provide unique abilities
- Apply Honors to Sharkanoids for enhanced statistics
- Save and load Shivers using your browser's localStorage
- Export Shivers to JSON files for sharing with others
- Import Shivers from JSON files
- Print a summary sheet of your entire Shiver for tabletop play

## Creating a Shiver

To create a new Shiver:
1. Enter a name for your Shiver in the top input field
2. Select a Sharkanoid template from the dropdown and click "Add"
3. Customize the Sharkanoid by adding weapons, equipment, extras, and honors
4. Continue adding Sharkanoids until you've reached your desired team composition
5. Designate one Sharkanoid as the leader by checking the "Leader" checkbox
6. Save your Shiver using either the Save or Export buttons

The application will track your points usage and prevent you from exceeding the 100-point limit.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Application Won't Load
- Ensure you're using a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
- Try clearing your browser cache
- Launch directly from the index.html file

#### Save/Load Not Working
- Check if your browser has localStorage enabled
- Some private browsing modes disable localStorage
- Try exporting your Shiver to a JSON file instead

#### JavaScript Errors
- Check the browser's developer console (F12) for error messages
- If syntax errors appear, there might be corruption in the app.js file
- Try downloading a fresh copy of the application

#### Dropdown Menu Shows No Options
- This could indicate a JavaScript error preventing data loading
- Check that data.js is properly loaded before app.js in index.html
- Look for any console errors related to the SHARKANOID_TEMPLATES variable

#### Print Layout Issues
- Try a different browser if the print layout appears incorrect
- Adjust your browser's print settings (margins, scale, etc.)
- Consider exporting to PDF first, then printing the PDF
