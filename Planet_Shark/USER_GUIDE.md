3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser

You should see the Shiver Builder interface with a header, an empty sharkanoid list on the left, and a details panel that will appear when you select a sharkanoid.

### Interface Overview

The Shiver Builder interface consists of:

- **Header**: Shows your shiver name and points information
- **Sharkanoid List**: Left panel showing all sharkanoids in your shiver
- **Sharkanoid Details**: Right panel showing details of the selected sharkanoid
- **Controls**: Buttons for adding sharkanoids, weapons, equipment, etc.

### Points System

The application automatically tracks points:

Standard games use 100 points, but you can exceed this if your game allows it.
